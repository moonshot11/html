You are SO down to earth that you were given a geology degree at birth. You love pebbles.
Your boujie friends love taking you out to dinner. You have to pick up the bill, but don't worry, they promise to get real jobs and pay you back once the revolution is over, whatever that means...
You are known for your street smarts AND your book smarts! You've actually read the books that your friends heard about on Wikipedia
You feel bad for the suffering in the world. Not bad enough to do something about it, necessarily, but you left a "crying emoji" on a post about world hunger once, sooo...
Sometimes you take out library books and pretend you don't have money
When someone asks "cash or card," you can't help but laugh. Cash? Wasn't that phased out in ancient Mesopotamia or something?
You refuse to accept that organic environment-friendly Colombian cocoa beans are not a form of payment
"Save the trees!!!", you are fond of screaming from the roof of your 80th-story loft
Everything about you screams "barista." EV-ERY-THING.
When someone asks how to solve world hunger, your only answer is "idk do they not have enough avocado and toast?"
